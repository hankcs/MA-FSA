This is a minimal acyclic finite-state automata algorithm in Java based on the paper, "Incremental Construction of Minimal Acyclic Finite-State Automata".

It can be used/modified for things like spell checking and autocomplete.

The included word list has 250,000+ words and searching through them is very fast. On a Core i3, I can get about 250,000 lookups in 100ms.

Usage:

Path path = Paths.get("/path/to/wordlist.txt");
List<String> words = Files.readAllLines(path, StandardCharsets.UTF_8);

Dawg dawg = new Dawg(words);

if(dawg.search(word))
    System.out.println("Word found.");
